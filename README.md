# Chrome Extensions Privacy Policy
## Effective Date: 11/9/2024

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of my Google Chrome extension(s).

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how the Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your data. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is respected and protected.

## Information Collection
My Google Chrome Extensions do not collect any personal information from users. The only data stored is non-personal and includes:

- **Sound preference (mute/unmute status)**
- **High scores**
- **Game settings** such as theme color, tile size, and game speed (if customized by the user)

I do not gather, store, or transmit any data that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, or location. Since no personal data is collected, none of your data is sold to third parties.

## Data Storage
All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. No data is transmitted to external servers. This ensures that your game preferences and high scores remain private and secure on your device.

## Permissions
The extension requires the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save your game preferences, high scores, and other game settings locally on your device.
- **activeTab**: To open the game in a new tab, toolbar popup, or stand-alone window, if chosen by the user.

## Usage of Data
The data collected is used solely for the purpose of enhancing your gaming experience. Here are some specific uses:

- **Sound preference**: To remember whether you prefer the game sounds to be muted or unmuted.
- **High scores**: To track and display your highest scores achieved in the game.
- **Game settings**: To apply your preferred theme color, tile size, and game speed each time you play the game.[Coming soon]

## Data Security
We take the security of your data seriously. Since NO data is stored locally on your device, we do not transmit any data to external servers.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
There will be no further change to the Privacy Policy

## User Rights
You have the right to know what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is shared. You also have the right to request access to, correct, or delete any data that might be stored locally on your device.
Since no data is stored, this is just for obligatory purposes.
