## Privacy Policy

### Screen Scoutr Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 4/16/2025**

#### Introduction

Screen Scoutr ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our browser extension. 

Screen Scoutr is designed with privacy as a priority, following a principle of minimal data collection and local processing. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices.

#### Information We Collect

**We do not collect or store any personal information from users.**

The extension operates by:
- Capturing screenshots of areas you explicitly select or your entire viewport when you request it
- Storing your preferences and settings locally in your browser
- Storing your API keys locally in your browser
- Keeping analysis history locally in your browser

**API Processing:** When you use AI analysis features, screenshots are sent directly to the AI model provider (e.g., OpenRouter) using your own API key. We do not have access to your API keys or the content of your screenshots.

#### Data Storage

All user data, including:
- API keys
- Preferences
- Capture history
- Analysis results

is stored locally on your device using the browser's built-in storage mechanisms. This data never leaves your device except when you explicitly initiate an analysis request, at which point only the image data is sent directly to the AI provider you've configured.

#### Third-Party Services

Screen Scoutr allows you to connect to third-party AI analysis services like OpenRouter. When you use these features:

- You provide your own API keys for these services
- The extension sends image data directly to these services for analysis
- The use of these services is subject to their own terms and privacy policies
- We have no control over or access to data processed by these third-party services

#### Data Security

To protect your information, we:
- Do not collect or transmit data to our servers
- Store all information locally on your device
- Use HTTPS for any API communication with third-party services
- Never share your API keys or captured content

#### Children's Privacy

The extension is not intended for and should not be used by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

#### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the extension's documentation and updating the "Last Updated" date.
